    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would tell the client to have a secure password with both lower and uppercase letters with numbers, I'd strongly suggest a third-party solution for log-ins. 
      They should also have regular updates/deploys, as well as having their browsers and programs updated. Their site should be a HTTPS and not just HTTP as the first one is much more secure. 
      The client should avoid logging into their webpages on public networks and have a well maintained backup(s). 
      A 'session expiration' for their page could also be implemented so that idle customers are logged off.]</p>
