    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would tell the client to Sanitize data and use third party solutions, have continious updates/deploys to mainain a healthy codebase. They also need a secure network, a 'session expiration' should also be set for their website to automatically log customers out after a long time being idle on their page.]</p>
